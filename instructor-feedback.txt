Overall Feedback:

1. The css is well organised and using mostly clear class names.
2. I created a .gitignore file to ignore node modules being uploaded to github
3. There are lots of images outside of the assets folder this needs to be organised.
4. The HTML files are well structured using the correct HTML tags and reducing any unecessary doe.
5. Good use of the contries JS file to separate the code and improve the readability.
6. Overall the JavaScript is well implemented and the use of comments to explain the more complex parts of the code which were brought in from external
places is really good to see.
7. Next steps would be to deploy it to Netlify.
